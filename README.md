# ForradiaGame

Forradia is a 2D sandbox RPG game that I am developing for fun and to improve my C++ skills. It is early in its development and currently features only basic combat, crafting and NPC interaction. My intention is to give the game an unique feeling with an unusual elevation representation in a 2D perspective and all characters (player and monsters), simply being visualized as boxes. The game is heavily dependent of procedural generation, currently for the map generation.

Forradia is platform independent and open source.
